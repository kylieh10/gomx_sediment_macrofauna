The intended user of this notebook is a person who has been tasked with publishing data that has already been published to ScienceBase via the USGS data release process. However, the basic structure and concepts should apply for any data that is being mobilized (e.g. published to) GBIF and OBIS. Basic knowledge of R is needed, but you do not need to be an expert. Similarly, basic knowledge of the Darwin Core, and Ecological Metadata Language (EML) standards is useful, but you do not need to be an expert. Finally, this notebook will be most useful if it can be built on through repeated use. Knowing how to use Git, and either USGS Gitlab or Github, will help the user version control the evolution of their approach to data mobilization, but if you have never used Git before, there is a section included that points you toward some good lessons.
