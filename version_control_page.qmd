# Version Control with Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that underlies commercial products like [Github](https://github.com/) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Github is a public platformed owned by Microsoft and used by many scientists. In contrast, USGS maintains a private instance of Gitlab (<https://code.usgs.gov/>) that is regulated by USGS and [subject to USGS and DOI policy about code sharing](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/SitePages/Home.aspx). In addition to making sure you understand how to use git, please make sure you understand USGS policy about how to properly use Gitlab and Github.
